### FSIG-Specific Considerations

**Antitrust Compliance:**
All contributions and discussions must comply with the [MCP Antitrust Policy](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/blob/main/ANTITRUST.md).

**Do NOT discuss:**

- Market division or competitive coordination
- Confidential business information

**Focus on:**
- Technical standards and specifications
- Implementation approaches
- Interoperability patterns
- Documentation and testing

## Extension Development

When developing MCP extensions for financial services:

1. **Start with a Proposal**
   - Open an issue describing the extension
   - Discuss use cases and requirements
   - Get feedback before implementation

2. **Follow MCP Standards**
   - Align with the [MCP Specification](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io)
   - Use standard MCP patterns and conventions
   - Document deviations clearly

3. **Include Documentation & Examples**
   - Clear README with purpose and usage
   - Working examples demonstrating the extension
   - Implementation notes and considerations

4. **Consider Broad Applicability**
   - Could this extension benefit other domains?
   - Is there potential for promotion to core spec?
   - Document use cases beyond financial services

## Proposing Core Spec Enhancements

If you believe an extension should be promoted to the core MCP spec:

1. **Gather Implementation Experience** ‚Äî Deploy in real scenarios and collect feedback
2. **Discuss with FSIG** ‚Äî Present at a meeting and get consensus from maintainers
3. **Contact Core Maintainer Liaison** ‚Äî Reach out to [David Soria Parra](https://github.com/dsp-ant)
