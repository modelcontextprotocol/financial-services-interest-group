# FSIG Governance & Members

This document describes the governance model, roles, and current members of the MCP Financial Services Interest Group (FSIG).

## Governance Model

FSIG operates with a **lightweight, consensus-driven governance model**:

- **Decision-making:** Consensus among maintainers
- **Maintainer responsibilities:** Coordinate meetings, maintain repo hygiene, facilitate collaboration, review/merge PRs, make governance decisions
- **Transparency:** All decisions documented in meeting notes or GitHub issues
- **Open participation:** Anyone can contribute, attend meetings, and provide input

### Decision-Making Process

1. **Proposals** are raised via GitHub Issues or during meetings
2. **Discussion** happens in public channels (Discord, GitHub, meetings)
3. **Consensus** is reached when no maintainer objects (lazy consensus)
4. **Objections** trigger further discussion to find compromise or alternative approaches
5. **Documentation** of decisions happens in meeting notes or issue threads

For technical decisions, maintainers may defer to subject matter experts or request broader community input.

### Core Principles

1. **Open participation** — Anyone can contribute regardless of affiliation or background
2. **Transparent decisions** — All work happens in public with documented rationale
3. **Consensus-driven** — Decisions made by maintainer consensus with community input
4. **[Antitrust compliance](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/blob/main/ANTITRUST.md)** — Stay within technical scope and avoid competitive coordination
5. **Community-aligned** — Collaborate with other MCP groups and align with broader ecosystem goals
